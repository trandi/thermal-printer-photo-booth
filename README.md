# thermal-printer-photo-booth
Take an old thermal printer like those that print receipts in a supermarket till, hack it for manual control, add a Raspberry Pi with its camera and obtain a minimalist and low-res photo booth...  With some Haskell code running the show, of course !

With a fresh checkout:
- **stack build**  
- probably **stack setup** (as your ghc won't be matching)  
- then **run** the generated executable (for example "*.stack-work/dist/x86_64-linux/Cabal-1.24.2.0/build/thermal-printer-photo-booth-exe/thermal-printer-photo-booth-exe*")  
- **stack test** if you feel so inclined...  

(The first build/setup does take a while on a Raspberry Pi !)
